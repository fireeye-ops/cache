## overview

I am a 20 year old systems administrator and server firefighter with an aspiration of becoming a part of the DevOps movement.

## work experience

### [hostgator.com, llc][], austin, tx

#### systems administrator - june 2011 to present

Part of a large team of administrators, we resolve thousands of issues per day, as a popular web host, across thousands of shared servers, virtual private servers and dedicated servers. These range from common database issues, backups and restorations, and reboot triage to web server/database tuning, major software upgrades and custom installations, filing bug reports and more.

#### systems monitoring - december 2011 to present

As one unit of a small team of monitors (3-4 usually), we proactively monitor the entire farm for issues before they become major. Issues I handle range from CPU abusers, low disk space, and hard drive errors to Denial of Service attacks/flooding, disaster recovery, and individual site performance reviews.

## volunteer experience

### [the bike project of urbana-champaign][] - august 2010 to february 2011

#### bike mechanic

Assisted visitors to the on-campus shop with maintaining and building bicycles, and created the sister [registered student organisation][] on campus as the president.

#### technologist

Repurposed two decade-old computers to use around the shop/help business flow in the organisation. Also managed membership information and helped to create a scalable membership system.

### [knights of reason][] - march 2008 to present

#### member/developer

I assist the webmaster in site design in development, for the most part (as a friend). I have submitted a C patch in the KoRx bug tracker (just one!), and previously moderated the servers and forums.
